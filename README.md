# `bf.py` - A BrainFuck interpreter

`bf.py` is a brainfuck interpreter written in 1 line of python and 972 characters.

The annotated source with comments can be found in `bf-annotated.py`.

Both interpreters assume valid input is given as input, otherwise ugly errors from the Python interpreter will be given as output.

## Examples

Look in my other GitHub repository [bfcc](https://github.com/dc03/bfcc) under the `examples/` directory.

## License

Both `bf.py` and `bf-annotated.py` are licensed under the MIT license.
